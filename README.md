# Pokedex-app
- A basic pokedex app made using the volley,glide libraries.

- This app involves creating a good UI layout, making a request with volley, parsing JSONArrays and JSONObjects, passing data between activities using bundles and intent.

- This app helped me understand about JSON and parsing.
